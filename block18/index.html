<!-- `Multiplication` Function
 1. Expect: (5*5) to return 25
 2. Expect: (number*number) to return a number
 3. Expect: (5.-102b*5) to return as an error
            Functional Tests
 4. Create a function that tests a range of numbers against its multiplier to check if it returns the correct numbers.
 5. When the user adds multiple of the same item in their cart make sure it charges them the correct amount.
 6. When programming multipliers in games such as (increasing movement speed after collecting an item by a %, damage increase per level, collision damage relative to speed, etc.)

<!-- `concatOdds` Function
 1. Expect: ([1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]) to return [3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7]
 2. Expect: ([10,20], [2,2]) to return [10,2,20,2]
 3. Expect: ([]1,2,3), [(211,,2)] to return as an error
            Functional Tests
 4. When a user incorrectly inputs information into a prompt and needs to change it, make sure the function to check the function to make sure it correcly allows the user to input new data and that it stores the most recent array.
 5. When a user repeatedly clicks the submit button as well as other buttons when filling out information make sure it correctly resets the prompt when navigating back to it.
 6. How would the calculation be affected if you repeat the same value within the same array.
 7. How does the result change if you add numbers and symbols into your array?
